Clima_WeatherApp Project Goal:

Develop a user-friendly iOS application that retrieves and displays the current weather conditions for a user-specified location. The displayed information will include:

Temperature Weather description A corresponding weather condition image (using SF Symbols) Features:

User location detection (optional) Ability to search for weather by location name Clear and concise weather data presentation Condition Codes:

The application utilizes a mapping system to translate weather condition IDs provided by the weather API into corresponding SF Symbols representing the weather condition. Here's the breakdown:

Swift Condition Code :  case 200...232:       return "cloud.bolt"     case 300...321:       return "cloud.drizzle"     case 500...531:       return "cloud.rain"     case 600...622:       return "cloud.snow"     case 701...781:       return "cloud.fog"     case 800:       return "sun.max"     case 801...804:       return "cloud.bolt"     default:       return "cloud"

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Swift Development Platform: Xcode UI Framework: UIKit (or SwiftUI) Networking: URLSession (or a networking library) Weather Data Source: A weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
